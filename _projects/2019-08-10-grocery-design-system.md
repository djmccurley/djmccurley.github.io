## Problem

As the Aisles Online mobile app scaled and new engineers joined the project, implementing consistent visual designs across the platform became difficult. The increasing velocity also made testing and delivering designs on deadline a challenge. We created the Grocery Design System to help address both issues.

## Role

I started as the sole UI/UX designer on the project, collaborating with a team of five engineers, the tech lead and the product owner to implement the design system across the app. As more teams and designers joined the project, I worked with them to onboard them into the system.





## Process

I inventoried all the styles, colors and layouts that had accumulated in the app over 8 months of design and development. From there, I reduced the inventory to a shared set of styles and layouts that would fit all of our existing work and provide flexibility for upcoming features. I documented the system for developers and created a shared repo of Sketch libraries for my design colleagues.

## Solution

The Grocery Design System benefitted our team by establishing a common language between design and engineering and by reducing the number of choices to be made while building the app. Using the established set of definitions and components enabled designers to iterate and prototype faster and helped developers implement designs quickly and accurately.



## Challenges

Implementing the design system required extensive refactoring of existing code â€“ not an easy sell to an already lean dev team. I routinely made a point to demonstrate the value of the system for engineers and product leadership, not just designers, as I advocated for its adoption.

## Outcomes

Adopting the Grocery Design System freed up more time for research, prototyping and testing in our design process, and it reduced the amount of dev rework spent correcting visual design. We also saw fewer user interface bugs reported, thanks to the included guidelines around accessibility and font-scaling.

## Reflection

We learned that by minimizing the amount of choices to be made around a feature's design, we can maximize the output and efficiency of a small team. The Grocery Design System provides a solid foundation from which we can scale the Aisle Online app and better serve customers at the same time.

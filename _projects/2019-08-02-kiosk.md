## Problem

Hy-Vee sought to decrease customer wait times for in-store food service and provide a flexible self-service platform for various store formats. We were tasked with delivering a solution that allowed customers to order and check out in under 30 seconds while still upholding Hy-Vee's hallmark customer service and brand. 

## Role

Working with a fellow designer, I synthesized business and customer requirements and delivered flows, wireframes and hi-fidelity visual designs on a very tight timeline. After launch, I conducted in-store user testing with customers and helped the dev team quickly iterate on and deploy design enhancements.

## Process

We worked to ensure all our customer flows scaled across relatively simple menu items (likedrinks) and complicated, multi-step orders (burritos). We use quick turnaround cycles and daily design reviews to iterate on visual designs.

## Solution

 Usability testing showed that customers were able to order and check out well within our 30-second goal. The visual design of the kiosk showcases Hy-Vee's culinary expertise while remaining accessible and intuitive.

## Challenges

We struggled to account for many of the physical constraints of the kiosks during the design phase, such as in-store layouts, signage, and customers' movements while shopping. For example, we designed the post-checkout flow under the assumption that cups and order buzzers would be readily available near the kiosks, which turned out not to be true in many stores.

## Outcomes

The kiosks are currently deployed in Hy-Vee stores across the midwest. They provide convenient ordering options for customers and they enable flexible staffing options for stores during off-peak times.

## Reflection

The in-store testing I conducted for this project (and resulting iterations) demonstrated the importance of requirement gathering, stakeholder interviews and challenging assumptions to our leadership. We saw the intersection of digital and physical UX as it affected customers first hand.

## Codeboy 1.0

A fun web app that allows users to encode and decode secret messages to and from their friends (or enemies). With a heavy influence from 80's action movies and GI Joe cartoons, the app is great for sending encoded messages like 'GET TO THE CHOPPA!' and 'WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR? DO IT NOW!'

Users can enter text and see the live output as they type. They can also switch between Encode and Decode modes, as well as change 'code channels' (varying rot-n codes). Finally, the output can be copied to the clipboard or sent as a tweet.

I'm currently working on converting Codeboy to be a PWA for offline espionage.

## Receipt Splitter

This responsive web app helps you categorize expenses from a receipt. Let's say you went to Target and spent $100 on some groceries, some toiletries and some baby supplies. Now you want to enter your expenses into your monthly budget categories, but you aren't sure how much of that $100 you spent in each category.

I built this app to help with our monthly budgeting using YNAB. YNAB is great software, but it didn't allow me to split receipts like this in the app itself. This project grew out of a local spreadsheet that I wanted to access while on the go.

## Wikipedia Search

This responsive web app allows users to search for Wikipedia articles using the Wikipedia API. I built this app from scratch for a class project. The inspiration for the app is from a freeCodeCamp coding challenge.
